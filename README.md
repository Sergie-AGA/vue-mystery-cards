# vue-mystery-cards

## About
This project was initially made to randomly decide the order in which I would play games with other people. You can simply add JSON objects to an array and it renders many cards in a random order and facing back. When you click on it it reveals what is behind the card. This can be used for any items you may want to hide behind a random flipped card

## Features
The most recent update allows you to set items to be unlocked only when you have a silver or golden key, which is obtained by flipping other cards. Flipping these includes a reveal animation. You can easily decide how many normal flips are required before obtaining a key.
